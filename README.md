The book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) contains an example app [contact-app](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/contact-app) that is used to demonstrate [htmx](https://htmx.org/).

This is a port of `contact-app` to [FastHTML](https://www.fastht.ml/).

Implementation is in file [app-fasthtml-000.py](https://github.com/dharmatech/contact-app-fasthtml.py/blob/main/app-fasthtml-000.py).

The port is not yet complete.

See issues for parts that are yet to be converted.

Feel free to add issues.
